# Developing-a-Machine-Learning-Model-to-Predict-Prices-for-Rental-Properties
## Introduction
This project aims to build a machine learning regression model to predict the prices of Rental properties. The model will analyze various factors such as property size, location, amenities, and market trends to provide accurate price estimates. This will help property owners set competitive prices and assist guests in making informed booking decisions.

## Data Collection
The data for this project is collected from various sources, including:

Real estate listings
Property management databases
Market analysis reports
Key features collected:

Property location
Property size (square footage)
Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
Amenities
Age of the property
Historical price trends
Data Preprocessing

## Steps involved in data preprocessing:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Create new features like price per square foot and neighborhood quality index.
Data Transformation: Normalize or standardize numerical features and encode categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves:

## Computing descriptive statistics for numerical features.
Visualizing data distributions and relationships using histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
Creating a correlation matrix to identify relationships between features and prices.

## Model Selection
Regression algorithms considered:

## Linear Regression
Model Training and Validation
Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).
